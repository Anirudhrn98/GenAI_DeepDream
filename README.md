# Generative AI - DeepDream Algorithm 

This project explores creative applications of AI, particularly focusing on image manipulation and feature extraction. It involves blending images, using InceptionNet for transfer learning, and manipulating image data.

## Features

Image blending techniques.

Use of InceptionNet model for advanced image processing.

Techniques for normalizing and manipulating image data.

Extracting and maximizing activations of certain layers in a neural network.

## Requirements

Key libraries include TensorFlow, NumPy, and related image processing libraries.

The required packages can be installed using the following code: 

```pip install tensorflow numpy pillow```


## Data

The project utilizes openly available images from sources like PxFuel and Wikimedia Commons.


## Usage

Follow the notebook to understand how to load images, blend them, and use the InceptionNet model. Make sure to have the images ready for processing.


## Models

The notebook uses the InceptionNet model, a deep convolutional neural network, for feature extraction and image processing.

## Results

Results include blended images and analyses of image features extracted by the neural network.
